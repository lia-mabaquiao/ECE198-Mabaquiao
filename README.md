# ECE198-Mabaquiao
All files for Lia Mabaquiao's undergraduate project named
ECE 198: VST Implementation of Formant-Corrected Hamonizer System

Some notes:
(1) Matlab VST Implementation needs more work

(2) We have two main files: main.m, and main.xls -- the contents of each script are copies of each other. One is a regular MATLAB script and the other one is a Live MATLAB Script. It is suggested to move one of the scripts out of your current working folder for the other one to work. 

Main reference code:
